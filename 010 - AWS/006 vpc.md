# **AMAZON VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (VPC)**



![Amazon_Virtual_Private_Cloud__VPC_](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/f2158319-559c-40b5-9ddc-aefd52e703ac)



+ **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** enables you to launch AWS resources into a **virtual network that you've defined.** This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

  
+ Inside this virtual network, you can deploy AWS computing resources. These resources include, for example, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances.

___


## **Why use an Amazon VPC:**


+ You can spin up a logical environment of what was previously in a data center within minutes in the cloud.
  
+ It is more **cost-effective** than maintaining equipment in a company data center.
+ **You pay for only the resources that you use.**
+ It’s **secure, scalable, and reliable.**
+ You can create multiple Amazon VPCs for testing, owning customer accounts, and more.



![WHY_VPC](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/f3c2310e-b0d0-47ad-ad14-366d22f4b4d6)

## **IP addressing in Amazon VPC:**


+ When you create a VPC, you must specify the IPv4 address range by choosing a CIDR block, such as 10.0.0.0/16.
  
+ An Amazon VPC address range could be as large as **/16 (65,536 addresses) or as small as /28 (16 addresses).**
+ Private IP ranges should be used according to **RFC 1918.**
+ IP addresses **should not overlap** with the addresses of other networks to which an Amazon VPC is connected.


**Private address range:**

| RFC 1918 range | Example Amazon VPC CIDR block  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255** | **10.0.0.0/16** |
| **172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255** | **172.31.0.0/16** |
| **192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255** | **192.168.0.0/16** |

## **Amazon VPC components:**


A VPC can span multiple Availability Zones, and its key component types include:

+ **Amazon VPC:** It is a logically isolated environment for your resources within the cloud. You can choose a Region here.

+ **Internet gateway:** An internet gateway is a VPC component that enables communication between instances in a VPC and the internet.



![IGW](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/8e3dd566-2221-46e4-9f22-7c80d0cef1c6)




+ **Subnet:** Subnets are logical network segments within your VPC. They enable you to subdivide your VPC network into smaller networks inside a single Availability Zone.

  - One subnet per Availability Zone because a subnet cannot span zones.

  - **Public Subnet:**  A public subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway.
    
  - **Private Subnet:** A private subnet does not have an internet gateway on the route table that is associated to it. However, a NAT gateway can be a route on this route table.
  - AWS reserves the first four IP addresses and the last IP address of every subnet for internal purposes.


**Example:**


| IP Address | Purpose  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **10.0.0.0** | **Network address** |
| **10.0.0.1** | **VPC router** |
| **10.0.0.2** | **Domain Name System (DNS) server** |
| **10.0.0.3** | **Reserved for future use** |
| **10.0.0.255** | **Network broadcast** |




+ **Route Table:**  A route table holds the route and target information required to route traffic within the Amazon VPC.

  - There are destinations and targets. Destinations hold IP addresses and ranges, and targets hold a service.

  - Each route table must be associated to a subnet.
    
  - A route table associates the subnet and gateways together.



![public   private route table](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/487d65ac-970f-4452-a7e7-479932207899)



  
+ **Security group:** A security group is a set of firewall rules that secure instances.
  
  - They allow or block inbound and outbound traffic into an instance.
  - Security groups are stateful.
  - Stateful means that if requests from your instance are sent, the response traffic is allowed to flow back regardless of the inbound rules.
  - A security group blocks all traffic by default; you must allow the protocol, port range, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) type, and source or destination.

  - If you do not specify a particular group at launch time, an instance is automatically assigned to the default security group for the VPC. 

  - A security group is associated with an instance.



![INBOUND   OUTBOUND](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/99c388d5-746a-4d49-bb2e-810f344c8f6e)




+ **Network Access Control List (NACL):** It acts as a firewall at the subnet level.

  - NACL are stateless.
    
  - Stateless means you seperately have to allow both request and response.
  - Network ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules.
  -  Each rule can either allow or deny traffic by increments of 10 or 100.


**Difference between Security Groups & NACL:**


| Security Group | NACL  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Operates at the **instance** level | Operates at the **subnet** level |
| Supports **allow** rules only | Supports **allow & deny** rules |
| **Stateful** | **Stateless** |
| Evaluates all rules | Process rules in order |
| Applies to an instance only if associated | Automatically applies to all instances in |



+ **Primary network interface (elastic network interface):** An elastic network interface is a virtual network interface (NIC) that connects an instance to a network. 

  - Each instance in a VPC has a default network interface, the primary network interface, which cannot be detached from the instance.


+ **Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway:** A NAT gateway permits instances in the private subnet to connect outside the VPC
  
  - The NAT gateway is assigned an Elastic IP address, which is a public IP address and is located in the public subnet.


![NAT](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/27c4a5c4-06e1-41e0-b5e8-b8a70476533b)

## **Features:**



+ **IP addressing:** You can assign IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses to your VPCs and subnets. You can also bring your public IPv4 and IPv6 GUA addresses to AWS and allocate them to resources in your VPC, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers.

  **Note:** You can only define VPCs with CIDR blocks of /16 through /28 inclusive, which means that a VPC can contain 16 – 65,536 IP addresses.

+ **Routing:** Use route tables to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

+ **Gateways and endpoints:** A gateway connects your VPC to another network. For example, use an internet gateway to connect your VPC to the internet. Use a VPC endpoint to connect to AWS services privately, without the use of an internet gateway or NAT device.

+ **Peering connections:** Use a VPC peering connection to route traffic between the resources in two VPCs.

+ **Traffic Mirroring:** Copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection.

+ **Transit gateways:** Use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections.


+ **VPC Flow Logs:** A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

+ **VPN connections:** Connect your VPCs to your on-premises networks using AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN).

## **Amazon VPC Use Cases:**

+ Hosting Web Applications.**

  
+ Hosting a Web or E-commerce site.**
+ Migrating workloads to the AWS cloud.**
+ Extending a Data Center to the cloud (Hybrid Cloud).**
+ Backup or Disaster Recovery.**
+ Security and Access Control.**

___

## **Pricing for Amazon VPC:**

+ There's no additional charge for using a VPC.
  
+ But there are charges for some of the VPC components, such as

  - **NAT gateways**
    
  - **IP Address Manager.**
  - **Traffic mirroring.**
  - **Reachability Analyzer.**
  - **Network Access Analyzer.**

+ For more information, see official [**Amazon VPC Pricing website.**](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/)
+ Or else you can use [**AWS Pricing Calculator**](https://calculator.aws/#/) to calculator your estimates.
